We are crafting a digital experience that feels both sophisticated and cutting-edge, akin to interacting with a high-tech interface from a visionary future. The design will leverage a dark, immersive color palette punctuated by vibrant, electric accents, creating a sense of depth and technological prowess. Layouts will be dynamic, employing calculated asymmetry and overlapping elements to guide the user through a visually striking and highly interactive journey.\n\n**Execution Blueprint:**\n1. **Geometric Foundation:** All visual elements, from backgrounds to component shapes, will be derived from sharp geometric primitives and layered compositions, mirroring the Staviya logo's DNA.\n2. **Dark Mode Immersion:** A deep, dark background palette will serve as the canvas, allowing vibrant accent colors and sharp typography to command attention and convey a premium, future-forward aesthetic.\n3. **Dynamic Asymmetry & Overlap:** Layouts will intentionally break from rigid grids, using negative space and overlapping elements to create visual tension, depth, and a sense of sophisticated technological advancement.\n4. **Typography as Structure:** Headings will be bold, geometric statements, while body text will be clean and highly legible, ensuring clarity and a modern, Apple-style hierarchy.\n5. **Interactive Depth:** Components will feature subtle glowing effects, glassmorphism, and precise animations to enhance the sense of layered complexity and technological sophistication.",

    "designSummary": "**The Geometric Nexus: A Future-Forward Digital Architecture**\n\nThe Staviya Software Solutions brand identity is built upon a foundation of precise geometric forms and layered complexity, directly inspired by the brand's logo. We are crafting a digital experience that feels both sophisticated and cutting-edge, akin to interacting with a high-tech interface from a visionary future. The design will leverage a dark, immersive color palette punctuated by vibrant, electric accents, creating a sense of depth and technological prowess. Layouts will be dynamic, employing calculated asymmetry and overlapping elements to guide the user through a visually striking and highly interactive journey.\n\n**Execution Blueprint:**\n1. **Geometric Foundation:** All visual elements, from backgrounds to component shapes, will be derived from sharp geometric primitives and layered compositions, mirroring the Staviya logo's DNA.\n2. **Dark Mode Immersion:** A deep, dark background palette will serve as the canvas, allowing vibrant accent colors and sharp typography to command attention and convey a premium, future-forward aesthetic.\n3. **Dynamic Asymmetry & Overlap:** Layouts will intentionally break from rigid grids, using negative space and overlapping elements to create visual tension, depth, and a sense of sophisticated technological advancement.\n4. **Typography as Structure:** Headings will be bold, geometric statements, while body text will be clean and highly legible, ensuring clarity and a modern, Apple-style hierarchy.\n5. **Interactive Depth:** Components will feature subtle glowing effects, glassmorphism, and precise animations to enhance the sense of layered complexity and technological sophistication.",

  "initialPrompt": "Design a high-end website for a software company named Staviya Software Solutions. The site must reflect the brand’s geometric, layered logo and use its color palette: deep blue, soft cyan/light blue, warm yellow, magenta accent, and neutral dark gray. The design should be premium, minimal, and future-forward, with abstract backgrounds and shapes derived from the logo geometry. Pages: Landing (desktop, tablet, mobile), Components (UI system), Color & Typography. Sections: Hero (cinematic headline, motion-ready typography, abstract geometric background), Brand Story (scroll-based storytelling), Services (interactive cards, geometric icons), Technology & Craft (grid/horizontal scroll), Why Choose Staviya (trust-focused, animated stats), Contact/CTA (minimal, enterprise look). Typography: modern, clean, Apple-style hierarchy. UI: auto layout, reusable components, variants, design tokens, organized layers. No templates or generic SaaS UI; design must be Awwwards-level, visually striking, and production-ready.",
